The PDF coalesce tool is a highly flexible solution that can perform multiple actions on PDF files, including merging,
splitting, adding, extracting, and viewing. PDFs are extensively used for sharing documents across various platforms
and devices, and the tool's capabilities can help manage these files more efficiently. Whether you need to combine
several PDF files into one document, extract specific pages, or compress PDFs, this tool can effortlessly perform these
tasks, making it a useful tool for managing PDF files based on your specific requirements.
## INSTALLATION
1) Installing Java JDK: Download and install the appropriate Java JDK distribution for your operating system from a
trusted source. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the JDK installation directory and add the JDK's "bin"
directory to your system's PATH variable.
2) Adding dependencies from pom.xml file: Open the pom.xml file in your project's root directory and add the
desired dependencies to the "dependencies" section by specifying their groupId, artifactId, and version.
3)Indexing the pom.xml file: Open a command prompt or terminal window, navigate to your project's root directory,
and run the command "mvn clean install" to build your project and create an index of its dependencies.
4) Running the main file: Open a command prompt or terminal window, navigate to your project's root directory, and
